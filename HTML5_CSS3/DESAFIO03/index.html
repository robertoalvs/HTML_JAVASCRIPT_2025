                <p class="paragra-aside1">Around the corner from our apartment there is a mosaics studio. Last year and the year before, I walked by and looked in wistfully, thinking how cool it would be to make some of the incredible mosaics they have displayed.</p>

                <p class="paragra-aside1">This year, I signed up. It’s a 22 hour workshop, spread into 2 hour chunks. I’ve been going Monday and Wednesday mornings, and it’s been great. I’ve learned how to cut ceramic tiles and also “gres” (their word for sandstone, and refers to a matte tile) and how to fit them together. I’ve got a bunch of ideas for more projects.</p>

                <p class="paragra-aside1">So, the other day we make our annual pilgrimage to the Sagrada Familia, and my favorite part is always watching what they’re working on, and there in the middle of the work area is a small pile of green and gold mosaic triangles, just like the ones I’ve been cutting…</p>
